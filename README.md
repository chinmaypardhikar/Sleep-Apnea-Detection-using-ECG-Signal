# Sleep-Apnea-Detection-using-ECG-Signal


**Project Description: -**
      
    Detect Sleep Apnea using ML and Mobile Application.


**Requirements: -**

    • AD8232 ECG Monitor Sensor Module
    • Android App
    • WIFI Module
    • Smartphone
    • Jumper Cables


**Key Components of Project: -**

    • Google Colab (Cloud): -
         Project on which we are working contains dataset of size 400MB having .csv
         Extension. To training these kinds of data on local machine is not possible because it needs a
         lot of computing power. Though I have tried it and my machine got hanged. That’s why I
         switched to Cloud (Google Colab)
         
    • AD8232 ECG Monitor Sensor Module
         This module can be used to detect and record ECG Data of patient which we need to
         detect weather that patient has sleep apnea or not
         
    • WIFI Module
         Data that we recorded has to be sent on cloud for prediction of Sleep Apnea for that
         purpose we need WIFI module using which we can send data on cloud.
         
    • Android App
         Whatever data that ECG Sensor has recorded can be send on cloud through Mobile
         app and also its result can be seen on mobile.



**High Level Design: -**
